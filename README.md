### 1: VANILLA JAVASCRIPT STOPWATCH

![Vanilla JavaScript stopwatch project](./src/images/image/Vanilla-JavaScript-stopwatch-project.png)

Coding a JavaScript stopwatch is an easy little project you can build in one day even as a beginner. Your stopwatch needs three buttons for user interaction:

1.  Start
2.  Stop
3.  Reset

Create a nice layout with some SASS to make it look pretty.
